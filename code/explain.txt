Please note, the code will not run until you make a config.js file in the same directory as the rest of the code and add:

window.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_api_key";

We are also using a custom Replit server to host our video calls, if you're planning to use it for your own projects, know that it will be turned off after this hackathon :P
